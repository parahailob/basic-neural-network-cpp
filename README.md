# basic-neural-network-cpp

An experimental project in which I tried to recreate a neural network in C++  from a book by Michael Nilson
http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/faq.html


To try out the network, compile and execute "src/testing.cpp" on your machine. This will train the network
on the training dataset of the MNIST database and then test the current state against the validation dataset.
